Notes:

If you use a virtual environment, you can generate this file with pip freeze > requirements.txt after installing all packages.
For Windows, you may need to install cmake and wheel before installing dlib:
pip install cmake wheel
pip install dlib
If you use a different YOLO library, adjust ultralytics accordingly.
